    "comment": "I voted YES for the Ecosystem Budget for Community Builders.\n\nRationale:\n\nA total of 7,568,810 ADA is needed to fund seven community builder projects that have surpassed the 2.69B ADA threshold, which represents 50% + 1 Lovelace of the active registered voting stake.\n\nIn GovTool and Ekklesia, I supported six out of the seven projects—but all seven are expected to have a positive impact on the ecosystem.\n\nFrom Ekklesia’s voting results, it’s clear that DReps overwhelmingly support these projects, and that should be acknowledged.\n\nThree of the seven projects—Midgard, Starstream, and ZK Rollup—specifically address scalability, which is the most pressing need for the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nGiven this context, voting YES was the only logical choice.\n\nFounding Entity Proposals:\n\nProposals from founding entities that also met the threshold were intentionally excluded from this governance action. Instead, they are invited to submit their own governance actions for budget requests.\n\nI fully support this decision, as it aligns with the ongoing community debate about the Net Change Limit (NCL).\n\nThe current NCL is set at 350M ADA, but a reduction is expected. Two governance actions have been submitted to adjust the NCL to 200M or 300M ADA.\n\nTo minimize spending, it’s best to decide on-chain for each proposal individually, rather than bundling multiple proposals into a single governance action.\n\nThis approach prevents situations where DReps who support IOG’s budget feel obligated to also back community proposals they disagree with.\n\nGiven the circumstances, Intersect has made the right decision, and I appreciate their approach."
