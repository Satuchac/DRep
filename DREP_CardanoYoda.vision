I'd like to share my vision for this position.

About Me:

With 20 years of experience as a programmer, I've specialized in building telecommunications and embedded systems, focusing heavily on protocols throughout my career.

I've been part of the Cardano community since 2017 and have served as a Cardano ambassador for a significant period. This year, I also joined Intersect.

Intersect chose me as one of the DRep training leaders. I possess a strong understanding of governance. 

However, it's important to highlight that on-chain governance is a new and uncharted territory. We will all be learning together as we navigate this space.

As a DRep, I am committed to upholding core blockchain principles such as decentralization, liveness, security, immutability, and sustainability.

In this role, I recognize the importance of long-term economic sustainability, especially as governance bodies make decisions regarding ADA withdrawals from the treasury.

Treasury:

Although the 1.52 billion $ADA in the treasury may seem like a substantial amount, it must be managed with great responsibility. 

By 2025, the treasury's income is projected to be around 300 million ADA, while current Catalyst Funds consume 50 million ADA, with several rounds potentially occurring each year.

It's possible to spend more ADA than the annual income in 2025, but it's also feasible to save more and spend less, thereby building a reserve for tougher times.

With a bull run anticipated next year and a potential rise in ADA's market price, it would be prudent to invest more during this period. Investing during a bear market would be more costly from ADA's perspective. 

Nonetheless, I believe that spending significantly more than 300 million ADA in 2025 would not be advisable.

Priorities:

The primary challenges facing the #Cardano ecosystem are low L1 scalability, low liquidity, and the absence of established stablecoins like $USDC and $USDT. These issues contribute to the current slight decline in DeFi users.

Addressing these challenges should be our investment priorities. Enhancing L1 scalability or developing the L2 ecosystem is essential to attract new users, which in turn will draw in capital and developers.

If the treasury can accelerate the development of Ouroboros Leios and Peras, as well as Hydra and ZK rollups, I would support such proposals.

As the number of users grows, the collected transaction fees will rise, which in turn will impact the staking rewards and treasury income.

Liquidity could be bolstered by allocating a portion of ADA to the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. We should have confidence in our ecosystem's ability to generate yields and aim to build a diversified portfolio. 

Tens of millions of ADA could be utilized for this purpose. However, it's crucial to carefully consider the details and establish clear rules first.

Catalyst should continue to support DeFi applications, tools and libraries, marketing, etc. Projects similar to Catalyst should not be financed directly from the treasury; if necessary, the Catalyst subsidy should be reduced. 

We can't afford to subsidize each Catalyst Fund with 50M ADA and simultaneously fund similar projects in another channel (via governance actions).

I would only approve projects from the treasury that have passed the CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) process.

We should begin exploring ways to link the CIP process with the treasury.

Regarding USDC and USDT, I am unsure of the current status, but it might be time to attempt again to bring these stablecoins to Cardano. For instance, if Circle required $10 million, it would equate to roughly 30 million ADA. I would consider this the maximum amount to allocate for this project. I would definitely like to hear the community's opinion on this matter.

When it comes to Catalyst and the treasury, we should consider supporting projects that can return ADA to the treasury. However, this may not always be feasible, such as in the case of supporting tools and libraries.

Others:

I likely wouldn't support changing parameter T, which determines the ratio between treasury income and staking rewards.

As for parameter K, which defines the number of preferred pools, any increase should only be considered after a thorough analysis of its impact on block diffusion speed and staking rewards.

As a DRep, I aim to remain open to other opinions and be flexible in my own views. I am eager to collaborate and engage in debates with fellow DReps.

I plan to communicate with the community and delegators primarily through X. My goal is to thoroughly research each topic and share my insights on the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal with the community.

I will frequently conduct polls to gauge community opinion. However, I will stand by my decisions and provide clear reasons for them.

Thank you to everyone who chooses to delegate ADA to me.
